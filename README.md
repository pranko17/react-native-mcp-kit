# react-native-mcp-kit

**See, drive, and debug a running React Native app from an AI agent.**

`react-native-mcp-kit` connects a running RN app — on simulator, emulator, or physical device — to any process that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). You wire it in once and the agent gets a concise, structured view of what's happening inside the running app: deep runtime-state analysis it can cross-reference in a single pass, full access to the React tree so it can find and reason about UI without screenshots and OCR, every kind of log the app produces, and simulation of real taps, swipes, and text input through the OS gesture pipeline. The whole surface is designed around what's cheap and fast for the agent to think about — lean responses by default, low vision-token cost on screenshots, a focused set of tools instead of overwhelming dumps.

```
AI Agent / Cursor / Claude Code --stdio/MCP--> Node server --WebSocket--> RN app (device)
                                                    │
                                                    └─ host tools (adb / xcrun / ios-hid) --USB/sim--> device
```

## Why would I want this?

A few concrete scenarios this unlocks:

- **Drive multiple devices in parallel from one agent session.** iOS simulator, Android emulator, physical device — any mix attaches to the same server. The agent can walk the same flow across platforms side-by-side, catching visual or behavioural regressions that show up on one OS but not the other, without ever leaving the editor.
- **End-to-end automation without a separate test harness.** Describe a multi-step flow in natural language — "sign in, open settings, flip the notifications toggle, verify the confirmation toast" — and the agent walks it: locates the right components, fires real taps through the OS gesture pipeline, asserts on the resulting state, and reports back.
- **Interactive inspection of a live app from your editor.** Ask "what screen am I on?", "what's in the request cache?", "what did the last POST return?", "what values are in app state right now?" — no rebuild, no DevTools panel, no "add more logs and reload" loop.
- **Debug gesture-arbitration bugs that unit tests can't catch.** Taps go through the real iOS/Android touch pipeline, so issues like "the close button inside a horizontally-scrolling list swallows taps" surface naturally — and when you need to sidestep the pipeline (call a prop directly, in a spot a real finger can't reach) the bridge offers that too.
- **Expose your own inspection points from inside components.** A component can register a named state key or an ad-hoc action from its own lifecycle. Agents then read feature-flag state, force a particular loading scenario, or trigger an internal-only action without you shipping a debug menu.

Everything the library adds to your bundle is stripped from production builds by default — wire it up once and leave it in, without shipping it to users.

## Example scenarios

- **Deep runtime-state analysis on demand.** Ask "why is this screen blank?" or "why did the last submission fail?" — the agent cross-references what's mounted in the UI, where the user is in the app, what the network has been doing, what errors fired, and any state the app has opted into exposing. All from the running runtime, no extra logging or rebuild. The same pass can be scoped to a specific moment ("state right after I tap submit") instead of a stale snapshot.
- **Reproduce a bug from a ticket, fix it, verify the fix.** The agent reads the reproduction steps, drives the app into the failing state through real taps and swipes, confirms the bug, edits the relevant source, then replays the same sequence to verify the fix — all in one editor session, no rebuilds between steps.
- **End-to-end flow narrated in plain language.** "Sign in, add an item to the cart, go through checkout, verify the total matches the expected value, screenshot the final screen, and give me a network traffic summary." The agent drives real taps, checks state at each step, snapshots the key screens, and hands back captured request counts / durations / errors as evidence.
- **Cross-platform parity check.** One agent holds two connected clients, runs the same tap sequence on iOS and Android in parallel, captures screenshots, and points out the differences — catches platform-specific regressions after an RN upgrade, shared-component refactor, or native change.
- **Implement a feature and verify it end-to-end.** Write the code, then hand the finished feature to the agent — it navigates to the affected screen, exercises the new controls, inspects component state and network calls, and confirms the expected behavior without you having to click through the simulator yourself.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-native-mcp-kit
# or
npm install react-native-mcp-kit
```

**Peer dependencies**: `react >= 19`, `react-native >= 0.79`, `react-native-device-info >= 10`.

## Setup

Three pieces need to be wired up: the **provider** at the root of your RN app, a pair of **babel plugins** so components are identifiable and production builds stay clean, and the **MCP server** that the AI agent talks to.

### 1. Wrap the app in `McpProvider`

Put it at the root of the tree. Optional props opt specific modules in — omit a prop and that module isn't registered.

```tsx
import { NavigationContainer, createNavigationContainerRef } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { McpProvider } from 'react-native-mcp-kit';

const navigationRef = createNavigationContainerRef();

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <McpProvider
      debug
      // Optional — each prop opts a module in:
      navigationRef={navigationRef} // → navigation module
      queryClient={queryClient} // → reactQuery module
      i18n={i18nInstance} // → i18next module
      storages={[{ name: 'mmkv', adapter: mmkvAdapter }]} // → storage module
    >
      <NavigationContainer ref={navigationRef}>{/* your app */}</NavigationContainer>
    </McpProvider>
  );
};
```

These modules register automatically on mount — no prop required:

`alert`, `console`, `device`, `errors`, `log_box`, `network`, `fiber_tree`

If the dependency lives deeper in the tree (e.g. the `QueryClient` is created inside a feature-specific provider), skip the prop and use `useMcpModule` there instead — see [Hooks](#hooks).

### 2. Babel plugins — why and how

Two plugins ship under `react-native-mcp-kit/babel`. You want both.

**`test-id-plugin`** — two transforms, one pass:

- Stamps every capitalized JSX element with a stable `data-mcp-id="ComponentName:path/to/file:line"` attribute. `fiber_tree` uses this to identify a component across renders, minification, and refactors. Without it you can still find components by `name` or `testID`, but mcpId is what makes "find the nth `ProductCard` on a specific line" reliable across a large codebase.
- Attaches `__mcp_hooks` metadata to each component function and each custom-hook function (`/^use[A-Z]/` with hook calls in body). This is how `fiber_tree__query` with `select: ["hooks"]` recovers hook names (`count`, `scrollRef`, …) instead of `State[0]` / `Ref[2]`. The plugin runs on `node_modules` too, so library hooks from react-redux / react-query get annotated automatically.

Run in **development**.

**`strip-plugin`** — strips every trace of mcp-kit from a bundle: imports from `react-native-mcp-kit`, calls to `McpClient.*` / `useMcpTool` / `useMcpModule`, the `<McpProvider>` JSX wrapper (its children are preserved), `data-mcp-id` attributes, and `__mcp_hooks = [...]` metadata assignments. Run this in **production** and none of the library code reaches your users.

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = (api) => {
  return {
    presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
    plugins: [
      __DEV__
        ? 'react-native-mcp-kit/babel/test-id-plugin'
        : 'react-native-mcp-kit/babel/strip-plugin',
    ],
  };
};
```

Both plugins accept options (attribute name, include/exclude lists, extra import sources, extra function names to strip) when you need to customize — pass them as the 2nd array element in the usual babel style. Defaults cover the common case.

After editing `babel.config.js` — or after installing / upgrading `react-native-mcp-kit` — clear Metro's cache once: `yarn start --reset-cache`. Metro aggressively caches transformed files, and until it re-runs the plugin on `node_modules`, `__mcp_hooks` annotations for library hooks will be missing and `fiber_tree__query` with `select: ["hooks"]` will return `null`.

### 3. Configure the MCP server

The MCP server is a Node process that brokers between your agent (stdio/MCP) and the RN app (WebSocket). It ships as a bin in the package — `npx react-native-mcp-kit` boots it.

Point your agent at it via the usual MCP config. For Claude Code / Cursor / Continue etc., a project-local `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-native-mcp-kit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["react-native-mcp-kit"]
    }
  }
}
```

**CLI flags:**

- `--port <number>` — WebSocket port the RN app connects to (default `8347`).
- `--no-host` — disable the host module (the server no longer exposes `host__tap`, `host__screenshot`, etc.). Use this when you only want in-app modules.

For **Android emulators** you need the adb port forward so the app can reach the server:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8347 tcp:8347
```

iOS simulators share localhost with the host machine, no forwarding needed.

### 4. Run

Start Metro + your app. The `McpProvider` connects to `ws://localhost:8347` on mount.

From your agent, a typical first session looks like:

```
connection_status
 → { clientCount: 1, clients: [{ id: "ios-1", label: "iPhone 17 Pro", ... }] }

list_tools { compact: true }
 → catalog of every module registered by the app, grouped by client
```

After that, every tool is callable by name via `call`. If the server isn't running yet, the provider just retries silently — no crash, no error toast.

## `McpProvider` reference

```ts
interface McpProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  debug?: boolean; // colored console logs for all MCP traffic
  navigationRef?: NavigationRef; // → navigationModule
  queryClient?: QueryClientLike; // → reactQueryModule
  i18n?: I18nLike; // → i18nextModule
  storages?: NamedStorage[]; // → storageModule(...storages)
  modules?: McpModule[]; // arbitrary extra modules
}
```

Wrap your whole app in it — every optional prop opts a module in when supplied.

## MCP server tools

The Node server exposes a small set of entry-point tools agents use directly — you don't register or configure them:

- **Discovery & dispatch** — `connection_status`, `list_tools`, `describe_tool`, `call`.
- **Test automation** — `wait_until` (poll any tool until a predicate holds, replacing screenshot-in-a-loop + sleep) and `assert` (single-shot checkpoint with a standardized diff on failure).
- **UI-level waits** — `fiber_tree__query` has a built-in `waitFor: { until: "appear" | "disappear", stable? }` option; see the [fiber_tree section](#fiber_tree).

## Host tools (device-level control)

When the `host` module is enabled (the default), the server exposes tools that operate **on the host machine** — they run `adb` / `xcrun simctl` / a bundled `ios-hid` binary. These work even when the RN app is frozen, not launched yet, or between reloads.

What you get:

- **Real OS input** — `tap`, `long_press`, `swipe`, `drag`, `type_text`, `type_text_batch`, `press_key`. Goes through the real iOS/Android touch pipeline.
- **`tap_fiber`** — one call to locate a component via fiber_tree and tap its center. No copy-paste of bounds between calls.
- **Screenshots** — WebP, auto-diffing (`unchanged: true` on identical frames). Pass `region` in physical pixels to crop to a specific element and keep vision-token cost low.
- **App lifecycle** — launch, terminate, restart.
- **Device enumeration** — list sims / emulators / devices, annotated with active MCP clients.

iOS input goes through a bundled `ios-hid` Swift binary that injects HID events directly into iOS Simulator via private frameworks — no external daemons to install or keep running.

## Metro tools (dev-server control plane)

Separate module talking HTTP / WebSocket to the Metro instance the app was bundled from.

- **Auto-detected URL per client.** Each attached app reports its actual Metro origin at handshake (via RN's `getDevServer()`). Non-default ports (`yarn start --port 8082`) and LAN-connected physical devices work without an explicit `metroUrl` arg.
- **`metro__symbolicate`** — maps a raw Hermes / V8 stack trace back to source paths via Metro's `/symbolicate`. Pairs naturally with `errors__get_errors` and `log_box__get_logs` (each entry has parsed `stackFrames` ready to feed in).
- **`metro__reload`** — triggers a full JS reload on every attached app (`POST /reload`).
- **`metro__status`** — cheap ping before a chain of Metro calls.
- **`metro__open_in_editor({ file, lineNumber, column? })`** — jumps `$REACT_EDITOR` to the exact line. Natural finisher after a symbolication flow.
- **`metro__get_events`** — reads a server-side ring buffer (200 events) fed by a lazy WebSocket to Metro's `/events` stream. Surfaces `bundle_build_failed`, `bundling_error`, `hmr_client_error`, `hmr_update`, `client_log`, etc. Key use: detecting silent HMR failures when the red box doesn't appear.

## Hooks

For when the thing you want to expose lives deeper than `McpProvider`:

```ts
useMcpTool(name, factory, deps); // register an ad-hoc tool tied to the component lifecycle
useMcpModule(factory, deps); // register a whole module from inside a component
```

Each follows `useMemo` / `useEffect` semantics — the factory re-runs on dep changes, registration cleans up on unmount.

```tsx
const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useMcpTool(
    'logout',
    () => ({
      description: 'Log out the current user',
      handler: async () => {
        await logout();
        return { success: true };
      },
    }),
    [logout]
  );

  return <UserContext.Provider value={user}>{children}</UserContext.Provider>;
};
```

Reading state is unified through `fiber_tree__query` with `select: ["hooks"]` — no manual exposure step needed. See the [fiber_tree section](#fiber_tree) below.

## Modules

| Module                    | Factory                         | Requires                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [alert](#alert)           | `alertModule()`                 | —                                         |
| [console](#console)       | `consoleModule(options?)`       | —                                         |
| [device](#device)         | `deviceModule()`                | —                                         |
| [errors](#errors)         | `errorsModule(options?)`        | —                                         |
| [fiber_tree](#fiber_tree) | `fiberTreeModule({ rootRef })`  | root ref (auto-supplied by `McpProvider`) |
| [i18n](#i18n)             | `i18nextModule(i18n)`           | i18next instance                          |
| [log_box](#log_box)       | `logBoxModule()`                | —                                         |
| [navigation](#navigation) | `navigationModule(ref)`         | React Navigation ref                      |
| [network](#network)       | `networkModule(options?)`       | —                                         |
| [query](#query)           | `reactQueryModule(queryClient)` | `QueryClient`                             |
| [storage](#storage)       | `storageModule(...storages)`    | one or more `NamedStorage`                |

The full tool list for every module is always available via `list_tools` at runtime — the sections below describe what each module gives you, not each tool.

### alert

Show a native `Alert.alert` from the agent with any combination of `default` / `cancel` / `destructive` buttons and get back which one was pressed. Useful for "are you sure?" prompts driven by the agent, or for surfacing a decision point to a human tester.

### console

Tails `console.log` / `warn` / `error` / `info` / `debug` into a ring buffer the agent can read or clear. Complex values (Errors, Dates, class instances, cyclic refs, functions, Symbols) are serialized safely. Buffer size, captured levels, and whether stack traces are collected are all configurable.

```ts
consoleModule({
  maxEntries: 200,
  levels: ['error', 'warn', 'log'],
  stackTrace: ['error', 'warn'], // or `true` / `false`
});
```

### device

Read-only view of platform facts (OS, version, dimensions in DP and physical pixels, pixel ratio, appearance, app state, accessibility settings, keyboard state) plus a few imperative actions — open URLs / settings, dismiss the keyboard, vibrate, reload the JS bundle in dev.

### errors

Captures unhandled JS errors (via `ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler`) and unhandled promise rejections. Each entry has parsed `stackFrames` designed to feed into `metro__symbolicate` — one call resolves bundle paths back to `src/components/Foo.tsx:42:10`.

### fiber_tree

The heart of UI inspection. Search the component tree via a chained `query`: each step narrows the result by **criteria** within a given **scope**, with multiple matches fanning out into the next step.

- **Criteria**: `name`, `testID`, `mcpId`, `text`, `hasProps`, `props` (equality + `contains`), `not`, `any`.
- **Scopes**: `descendants`, `children`, `parent`, `ancestors`, `siblings`, `self`, `screen` (focused screen fiber from React Navigation), `nearest_host` (closest host component).

Wrapper cascades (`PressableView → Pressable → View → RCTView`) collapse to the topmost by default, so overlapping matches don't drown the result. `bounds` come back in physical pixels and pair directly with `host__tap` — or use `host__tap_fiber` for the locate-and-tap shortcut.

Pass `waitFor: { until: 'appear' | 'disappear', timeout?, interval?, stable? }` to poll the same query until the target state is reached — e.g. `waitFor: { until: 'appear', stable: 300 }` waits for a screen to mount and hold stable for 300ms. Response carries `{ waited, attempts, elapsedMs, timedOut, stableFor? }` alongside the usual matches.

**Per-field projection.** Heavy fields — `props` and `hooks` — are projected per-field via `select`, so the rest of the response (mcpId, name, total) stays raw and always visible. Each takes its own `path` / `depth` / `maxBytes` knobs:

- `select: [{ props: { path: "data[0:5]", depth: 2 } }]` — drill into props.data[0..5) with 2 levels of expansion.
- `select: [{ hooks: { kinds: ["State"], names: ["isLoading"], withValues: true, depth: 2, path: "[0].value" } }]` — filter hooks by kind/name + project hook values.

Heavy nested values render as compact `${kind}`-keyed markers — `{"${arr}":47}`, `{"${fun}":"onPress"}`, `{"${str}":{ "len":1247, "preview":"..." }}` for long strings, `{"${Date}":"iso"}`, `{"${Err}":{ name, msg }}`, `{"${cyc}":true}`, `{"${ref}":{ mcpId, name }}` for component refs. Wide objects/arrays (>30 keys / >50 items) get a `${truncated}` sentinel as the first entry.

Hooks pull `useState` / `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `useRef` / `useEffect` / custom hooks with variable names recovered from source (via `__mcp_hooks` metadata from the test-id babel plugin). `withValues: true` adds resolved values; `expansionDepth` caps custom-hook recursion (`0` = top-level only); `format: "tree"` returns nested children instead of flat `via` chains. Sensitive names (password, token, jwt, secret, credential, apiKey, authorization, *Pin) are auto-redacted — override via `fiberTreeModule({ redactHookNames, additionalRedactHookNames })`. Works against any HOC chain (`memo`, `forwardRef`, custom HOCs, `as` casts) and library hooks from react-query, react-redux, reanimated, react-navigation.

### i18n

Inspect and manipulate an `i18next` instance: list keys, dump a whole translation resource, run a substring search, translate with interpolation, switch language at runtime.

### log_box

Control the React Native LogBox overlay: inspect current rows, dismiss or clear them, add ignore patterns (substring or `/regex/flags`), globally mute. Useful for clearing warning toasts that block automated UI flows. Dev-only — no-op in production.

### navigation

Drive React Navigation from outside — navigate, push, pop, replace, reset — and read the current route, nested state, and the last 100 transitions. Current-route responses include a `screen` field identifying the rendering component (`componentName`, `mcpId`, `filePath`, `line`). Needs a `createNavigationContainerRef()` passed to both `<NavigationContainer ref={…}>` and `<McpProvider navigationRef={…}>`.

### network

Intercepts `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` into a ring buffer — method, URL, status, duration, headers, bodies. Bodies are capped per-entry (default 20KB) and sensitive headers / body keys are redacted at capture time (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `password`, `token`, etc. — configurable). Query tools strip body data by default; fetch a specific body via `get_body({ id })`. WebSocket, Metro, and symbolicate traffic are auto-ignored.

```ts
networkModule({
  maxEntries: 200,
  bodyMaxBytes: 10_000,
  ignoreUrls: ['https://analytics.example.com', /\.png$/],
  redactHeaders: ['authorization'], // or false to disable
  redactBodyKeys: ['password'], // or false to disable
});
```

### query

React Query cache inspection: list cached queries, fetch cached data by key, get stats, and run `invalidate` / `refetch` / `remove` / `reset` against specific keys or the whole cache.

### storage

Reads and writes to one or more named key-value stores. Each store is a `{ name, adapter }` pair; the adapter can wrap MMKV, AsyncStorage, or any custom implementation that provides at least a `get`:

```ts
interface StorageAdapter {
  get(key: string): string | undefined | null | Promise<string | undefined | null>;
  set?(key: string, value: string): void | Promise<void>;
  delete?(key: string): void | Promise<void>;
  getAllKeys?(): string[] | Promise<string[]>;
}

storageModule(
  { name: 'mmkv', adapter: mmkvAdapter },
  { name: 'async', adapter: asyncStorageAdapter }
);
```

Without an `adapter.set` / `delete` / `getAllKeys`, the corresponding tools just report the operation as unsupported.

## Custom modules

Write your own module by returning an `McpModule`:

```ts
import { type McpModule } from 'react-native-mcp-kit';

const myModule = (): McpModule => ({
  name: 'myModule',
  description: 'Custom tools exposed to AI agents',
  tools: {
    greet: {
      description: 'Returns a greeting',
      handler: async (args) => ({ message: `Hello, ${args.name}!` }),
      inputSchema: { name: { type: 'string' } },
      timeout: 5000, // optional per-tool timeout, default 10s
    },
  },
});

<McpProvider modules={[myModule()]}>{…}</McpProvider>
// or
useMcpModule(() => myModule(), []);
```

Agents see the module + its tools in `list_tools` and call them via `call(tool: "myModule__greet")`.

## Dev vs production

- **Development** — test-id plugin on, strip plugin off. The `McpProvider` boots, tries to connect to `ws://localhost:8347`; if the server isn't running, no harm done — the bridge just stays disconnected and retries.
- **Production** — strip plugin on (test-id plugin off). The provider, all hook calls, every import from `react-native-mcp-kit`, and every `data-mcp-id` attribute vanish from the bundle. Nothing ships to users.

You don't need `if (__DEV__)` guards around mcp-kit usage — the babel plugin handles it.

## Debug logging

Pass `debug` to the provider to print every incoming request and outgoing response with color-coded module names and arrows. Logs use the pre-intercept `console.log`, so they never pollute the `console` module's buffer.

```tsx
<McpProvider debug>{…}</McpProvider>
```

## Local development (symlink / portal)

If you're developing the library next to an app and symlinking it in, Metro needs to know about the extra path:

```js
// metro.config.js
const path = require('path');
const mcpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../path-to/react-native-mcp-kit');

module.exports = {
  watchFolders: [mcpPath],
  resolver: {
    nodeModulesPaths: [
      path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
      path.resolve(mcpPath, 'node_modules'),
    ],
  },
};
```

## API reference

The recommended entry point is `<McpProvider />` — it owns the client singleton and you rarely need to touch `McpClient` directly. For advanced cases the class exposes `McpClient.initialize` / `getInstance` / `registerModule(s)` / `registerTool` / `setState` / `removeState` / `dispose` / `enableDebug` (all idempotent, `initialize` returns the existing instance on repeat calls).

Module and tool types:

```ts
interface McpModule {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  tools: Record<string, ToolHandler>;
}

interface ToolHandler {
  description: string;
  handler: (args: Record<string, unknown>) => unknown | Promise<unknown>;
  inputSchema?: Record<string, unknown>;
  timeout?: number; // default 10s
}
```
